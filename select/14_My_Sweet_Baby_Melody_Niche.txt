My sweet baby
You are just starting your journey
Blank pages in your book of life
What stories will fill these spaces?

Will you teach others to read
Will you care for those in need
Will you never give up on your dreams

Just know I'll be there for you
I'll always love you to the moon
A million times there and back
My sweet baby
You're perfect to me

My sweet baby
My heart melts when you smile at me
I hope the wonder in your eyes
Only gets bigger and brighter

Will you go to outer space
Will you find a cure that saves
Will you bring a smile to someone's face

Will you touch someone's heart
With your own work of art
Will you struggle to find your way

Just know I'll be there for you
I'll always love you to the moon
A million times there and back

My sweet baby
My sweet baby
How peacefully you sleep

My sweet baby
My sweet baby
You are perfect to me
