Baby, are you crying, do the
tears belong to me
Did you think our time together
was all gone
Well baby, you've been dreaming.
I'm as close as I can be
And I swear to you, our time
has just begun
Close your eyes, and rest your
weary mind
I promise, I will stay right
here beside you
The day our lives were joined,
became entwined
I wish that you could know how
much I love you
Baby, are you happy, do you
feel the way I do
Are there meanings, that you've
never seen before
Baby, my sweet baby,
I just can't believe that its
true
And its like...I've never ever
loved before
