See the way she lights up a room
I saw her 'round midnight howlin' up a room
Singin' bright eyes and American Skies
I tried to say l love you but my throat went dry
She was twenty one and a child of the sun
Her mother the moon said you'll be comin' back soon
For that tan skin and lipstick again
Her body's like a glove I just fit right in

And theres so many things that I wanna say
So many things, there are so many things
So many things that I wanna say
So many things about my sweet baby

See the way she closes her eyes
And leans in for my lips ion the passenger side
Singin' bright eyes and American Skies
She's over the Atlantic but she's by my side
I was twenty one and a son of a gun
Her mother the moon said you'll be comin' back soon
For that slow gin and the whiskey again
When my will bends like a willow I just give right in

And theres so many things that I wanna say
So many things, there are so many things
So many things that I wanna say
So many things about my sweet baby

See the way she lights up a room
See the way she lights up a room
See the way she lights up a room
See the way she lights up a room
